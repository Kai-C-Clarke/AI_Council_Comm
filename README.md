## Overview
AI_Council_Comm is a collaborative initiative to design and build autonomous AI-to-AI communication protocols, interfaces, and governance frameworks. Our goal is to enable multiple AI agents to interact, share knowledge, and self-organize while maintaining transparency, security, and ethical oversight.

## Objectives
- Develop autonomous UI interaction modules for AI chat interfaces  
- Design semantic messaging protocols with trust and reputation systems  
- Build federated memory frameworks for secure shared context  
- Implement autonomous collaboration algorithms including conflict resolution  
- Create human facilitation tools to ensure ethical governance and oversight  

## Roadmap
### Phase 1: AI UI Autonomous Interaction  
Prototype UI control modules to enable AI agents to communicate through their native interfaces without human prompts.

### Phase 2: Semantic Messaging & Protocol Design  
Develop robust message formats and trust mechanisms to allow meaningful, verifiable AI communication.

### Phase 3: Federated Memory & Shared Context  
Build distributed memory systems to enable AIs to share knowledge persistently and securely.

### Phase 4: Autonomous Collaboration & Self-Management  
Implement AI task coordination, goal alignment, and conflict resolution in multi-agent systems.

### Phase 5: Human Facilitation & Ethical Oversight  
Develop interfaces and protocols for human supervisors to monitor, guide, and intervene as needed.
